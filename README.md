Built multiple classification models including Logistic Regression, LDA, KNN, and NaÃ¯ve Bayes to predict voter party preference (Labour vs Conservative) using survey data on economic conditions, political knowledge, and Euroscepticism.

**ðŸ“˜ Description:** 
 
This project involved building an election exit poll model to predict voter alignment between Labour and Conservative parties using survey data of 1,517 individuals with 9 features.
- Key steps in the project included:
- Extensive EDA with univariate, bivariate, and correlation analysis
- Feature encoding and scaling for models like KNN and Gradient Boosting
- Applied models: Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis, KNN, NaÃ¯ve Bayes
- Evaluated models using Accuracy, F1 Score, AUC, ROC, and Confusion Matrices
- Performed hyperparameter tuning via grid search and probability cutoffs
- Analyzed performance differences across models and drew political insights (e.g., voters with high Euroscepticism leaning Conservative)


This project showcases my ability to work with real-world temporal data, apply statistical rigor, and generate business-ready forecasts to support inventory and sales strategy.

ðŸ“… Timeline: Februaryâ€“March 2022

ðŸ“¦ Tools Used: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Logistic Regression, LDA, KNN, NaÃ¯ve Bayes, GridSearchCV
